About the XDPoS
XinFin’s token XDC supplants proof-of-work consensus algorithm (popularly linked with mining and High Power Consumption) with proof-of-stake consensus algorithm, fundamentally using the concept of “validators” to Optimise Speed of the transaction, efficiency, reduce the cost of the infrastructure. This 
Validators are special nodes used in the DPoS consensus algorithm which validate each transaction occurring on the blockchain network. The result of this validation is to finally append the transaction on the blockchain. A transaction may be accepted by the validator or rejected. 

XDPoS relies on a system of 5000 Masternodes and 21 Validator node with Proof of Stake consensus.

XDPoS Supports all EVM-compatible smart-contracts and Protocol function but optimize GAS to reduce transaction fees near to zero to the user to make network more use-case friendly. 

XDPoS support Inbuild KYC/AML Feature to create Public trust network.
